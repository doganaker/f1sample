    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Born and raised a Bull, but now very much a Prancing Horse, F1's poster boy of early achievement had won more than all but two drivers in history by the time he was just 26, including back-to-back world titles between 2010 and 2013.

        Vettel’s trademark is pure pace – and of course his one-finger victory salute. In the chase to the chequered flag, he likes to lead from the front and just like his hero, Michael Schumacher, Vettel has settled in as a race-winning leader at Ferrari.

        But for all his competitive streak, Vettel has a playful side too and has been known to let loose with a spot of Beatles karaoke - and baby can he drive a car. Alongside his four world crowns he can boast more than 50 pole positions and race victories, ranking him – statistically - above many of the biggest names in F1 history. No wonder then that he was hand-picked to return Grand Prix racing’s oldest team to glory.

        Following his move to Maranello, Vettel’s rivalry with Lewis Hamilton intensified. Opposites off track – Hamilton leading a glamorous public life while Vettel is a private family man – the duo have often been all too evenly matched on Sundays as they bid not just for more world titles, but to be hailed the best of their generation.

        But now he faces an additional thorn in his side – young-gun team mate Charles Leclerc, the first man to outscore him over a season at the Scuderia - and Vettel will need to call on all his speed and experience if he’s to reassert himself over the ‘new boy’ in 2020.
